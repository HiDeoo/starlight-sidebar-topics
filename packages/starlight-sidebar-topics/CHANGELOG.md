  This option can be useful for custom pages generated and included in the sidebar by other plugins that have no knowledge of the Starlight Sidebar Topics plugin that should be associated with a specific topic.

  See the [“Unlisted Pages”](https://starlight-sidebar-topics.netlify.app/docs/guides/unlisted-pages) guide to learn more about how to associate pages with a specific topic.

### Minor Changes

- [#22](https://github.com/HiDeoo/starlight-sidebar-topics/pull/22) [`0e5806f`](https://github.com/HiDeoo/starlight-sidebar-topics/commit/0e5806fa351ff98ea927fe3c5b245dd28852a3a0) Thanks [@HiDeoo](https://github.com/HiDeoo)! - Adds a new [`exclude`](https://starlight-sidebar-topics.netlify.app/docs/configuration#exclude) plugin configuration option to exclude pages from any topic.

  This options can be useful for custom pages that use a custom site navigation sidebar which do not belong to any topic. Excluded pages will use the built-in Starlight sidebar and not render a list of topics.

  See the [“Excluded Pages”](https://starlight-sidebar-topics.netlify.app/docs/guides/excluded-pages) guide to learn more about how to exclude content pages from any topic.

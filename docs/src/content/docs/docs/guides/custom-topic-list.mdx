By default, the Starlight Sidebar Topics plugin [overrides](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/overriding-components/) the Starlight built-in [`<Sidebar>`](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/overrides/#sidebar) component to display a list of topics above the default sidebar content.

The plugin also exposes a route data object that contains all the information required to render a custom topic list in your project.

## What is route data?

Similar to [Starlight route data](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/route-data/), the route data provided by the Starlight Sidebar Topics plugin is an object containing the information about all the configured topics in your project.
It includes information like a list of all the topics, the label of each topic, and if the current page is part of a specific topic.

To learn more about all the available properties in the route data object, check the [`starlightSidebarTopics`](#starlightsidebartopics) section.

## Using route data

You can access the route data object provided by the Starlight Sidebar Topics plugin from the `Astro.locals.starlightSidebarTopics` global in Astro components:

```astro
---
// example.astro
const { topics } = Astro.locals.starlightSidebarTopics
//        ^ The list of all the topics in your project.
---
```

## Create a custom topic list

A custom topic list can be created using the route data object provided by the Starlight Sidebar Topics plugin.

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'
import CustomTopicListPreview from '../../../../components/CustomTopicListPreview.astro'

<Steps>

1. Prevent the Starlight Sidebar Topics plugin from rendering the built-in topic list by [overriding](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/overriding-components/#how-to-override) the `<Sidebar>` component in `astro.config.mjs`:

   ```js {10-13}
   // astro.config.mjs
   // @ts-check
   import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'
   import starlight from '@astrojs/starlight'

   export default defineConfig({
     integrations: [
       starlight({
         title: 'My Docs',
         components: {
           // Override the `<Sidebar>` component.
           Sidebar: './src/components/Sidebar.astro',
         },
       }),
     ],
   })
   ```

1. Create an Astro component for the `<Sidebar>` component override:

   This component can render anything you want, or only [reuse](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/overriding-components/#reuse-a-built-in-component) the default Starlight built-in `<Sidebar>` component.

   ```astro
   ---
   // src/components/Sidebar.astro
   import Default from '@astrojs/starlight/components/Sidebar.astro'
   ---

   <Default><slot /></Default>
   ```

1. Create an Astro component to replace the topic list based on the [`Astro.locals.starlightSidebarTopics`](#starlightsidebartopics) route data object:

   ```astro
   ---
   // docs/src/components/CustomTopicList.astro
   const { topics } = Astro.locals.starlightSidebarTopics
   ---

   <nav>
     {
       topics.map((topic) => (
         <a href={topic.link} aria-current={topic.isCurrent ? 'page' : false}>
           {topic.label}
         </a>
       ))
     }
   </nav>
   ```

   The basic example above iterates over all the topics in the route data object and renders a list of links to each topic:

   <CustomTopicListPreview />

   Up to you to customize the list as you want to match the look and feel of your project.

1. Choose the Starlight component that should be [overridden](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/overriding-components/#how-to-override) to render your custom topic list.
   You can find a full list of components in the Starlight [Overrides Reference](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/overrides/).

   :::tip
   Not sure which component you need to override? Use the [interactive Starlight Overrides Map](https://starlight-overrides-map.netlify.app/) to discover the names of Starlight’s UI components.
   :::

   The following example overrides the [`<SiteTitle>`](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/overrides/#sitetitle) component to render the custom topic list next to the site title in the header

   ```astro
   ---
   // src/components/SiteTitle.astro
   import Default from '@astrojs/starlight/components/SiteTitle.astro'
   import CustomTopicList from './CustomTopicList.astro'
   ---

   {/* Render the default site title. */}
   <Default><slot /></Default>
   {/* Render the custom topic list. */}
   <CustomTopicList />
   ```

</Steps>

For reference, you can also check the built-in topic list component in the Starlight Sidebar Topics plugin [source code](https://github.com/HiDeoo/starlight-sidebar-topics/blob/main/packages/starlight-sidebar-topics/components/Topics.astro) which also relies on the route data object to render the list of topics.

## `starlightSidebarTopics`

The `starlightSidebarTopics` object has the following properties:

### `topics`

A list of all the configured topics in your project.

Each topic object has the following properties:

#### `label`

**type:** `string`

The label of the topic.

#### `link`

**type:** `string`

The link to the topic’s content.

#### `isCurrent`

**type:** `boolean`

Indicates if the current page is part of the topic.

#### `icon`

**type:** `string | undefined`

The name of an optional icon associated with the topic set to one of Starlight’s built-in icons.
You can use the Starlight [`<Icon>`](https://starlight.astro.build/components/icons/) component to render the icon.

#### `badge`

**type:** `{ text: string; variant: 'note' | 'danger' | 'success' | 'caution' | 'tip' | 'default' } | undefined`

The optional badge associated with the topic.
You can use the Starlight [`<Badge>`](https://starlight.astro.build/components/badges/) component to render the badge.

### `isPageWithTopic`

**type:** `boolean`

Indicates if the current page is associated with a topic or not.

By default, the Starlight Sidebar Topics plugin expect that every [content pages](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/pages/#content-pages) in your project is associated with a topic.
This is done by including the content page in a [topic sidebar configuration](/docs/configuration#items) and the plugin will automatically determine which sidebar to display based on the current page.

However, there are cases where you may want to have a content page that is not listed in any topic sidebar while still displaying the sidebar of a specific topic.

## Configure content collections

Starlight is built on top of Astro's [content collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/), which are configured in the `src/content.config.ts` file.

To add support for unlisted content pages, update the content config file to add support for associating content pages with a specific topic:

```diff lang=ts ins="{ extend: topicSchema }"
// src/content.config.ts
import { defineCollection } from 'astro:content'
import { docsLoader } from '@astrojs/starlight/loaders';
import { docsSchema } from '@astrojs/starlight/schema'
+import { topicSchema } from 'starlight-sidebar-topics/schema'

export const collections = {
  docs: defineCollection({
    loader: docsLoader(),
    schema: docsSchema({ extend: topicSchema })
  }),
}
```

## Create a topic ID

To associate an unlisted content page with a specific topic, the topic must define an [`id`](/docs/configuration#id) in its [configuration](/docs/configuration#topic-configuration):

```js {16-17}
// astro.config.mjs
// @ts-check
import starlight from '@astrojs/starlight'
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config'
import starlightSidebarTopics from 'starlight-sidebar-topics'

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [
    starlight({
      plugins: [
        starlightSidebarTopics([
          {
            label: 'Guides',
            icon: 'open-book',
            link: '/guides/',
            // ID used to associate content pages with this topic.
            id: 'guides',
            items: ['guides/concepts', 'guides/courses'],
          },
        ]),
      ],
      title: 'My Docs',
    }),
  ],
})
```

## Associate a page with a topic

To associate an unlisted content page with a specific topic, you can use the `topic` [frontmatter](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/frontmatter/) field in the page's content file:

```md {4}
---
# src/content/docs/guides/support.md
title: Support
topic: guides
---

This is the support page.
```

For example, given the following file structure based on this guide:

import { FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'

<FileTree>

- src/
  - content/
    - docs/
      - guides/
        - concepts.md
        - courses.md
        - support.md

</FileTree>

Visiting the `guides/concepts`, `guides/courses`, and `guides/support` pages will all display the sidebar of the "Guides" topic.

- `guides/concepts` and `guides/courses` are explicitly listed in the "Guides" topic sidebar configuration under the [`items`](/docs/configuration#items) key.
- `guides/support` is not listed in the "Guides" topic sidebar configuration but is associated with the "Guides" topic through the `topic: guides` frontmatter entry.

'starlight-sidebar-topics': minor

⚠️ **BREAKING CHANGE:** The Starlight Sidebar Topics plugin no longer [overrides](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/overriding-components/) the [`<Pagination>` component](https://starlight.astro.build/reference/overrides/#pagination). If you were manually rendering `starlight-sidebar-topics/overrides/Pagination.astro` in a custom override, you can now remove it.

Adds support for Astro v5, drops support for Astro v4.

⚠️ **BREAKING CHANGE:** The minimum supported version of Starlight is now `0.30.0`.

Please follow the [upgrade guide](https://github.com/withastro/starlight/releases/tag/%40astrojs/starlight%400.30.0) to update your project.

Note that the [`legacy.collections` flag](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/legacy-flags/#collections) is not supported by this plugin and you should update your collections to use Astro's new Content Layer API.

Adds a route data object accessible on Starlight pages using `Astro.locals.starlightSidebarTopics` containing information about all the topics configured in your project. This can be useful to create custom topic lists to replace the built-in topic list.

See the [“Custom Topic List” guide](https://starlight-sidebar-topics.netlify.app/docs/guides/custom-topic-list/) for more information.

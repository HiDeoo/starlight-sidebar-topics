Adds a new [`topics`](https://starlight-sidebar-topics.netlify.app/docs/configuration#topics) plugin configuration option to map topic identifiers to a list of pages or glob patterns that should be associated with the topic.

This option can be useful for custom pages generated and included in the sidebar by other plugins that have no knowledge of the Starlight Sidebar Topics plugin that should be associated with a specific topic.

See the [“Unlisted Pages”](https://starlight-sidebar-topics.netlify.app/docs/guides/unlisted-pages) guide to learn more about how to associate pages with a specific topic.

Adds a new [`exclude`](https://starlight-sidebar-topics.netlify.app/docs/configuration#exclude) plugin configuration option to exclude pages from any topic.

This options can be useful for custom pages that use a custom site navigation sidebar which do not belong to any topic. Excluded pages will use the built-in Starlight sidebar and not render a list of topics.

See the [“Excluded Pages”](https://starlight-sidebar-topics.netlify.app/docs/guides/excluded-pages) guide to learn more about how to exclude content pages from any topic.
